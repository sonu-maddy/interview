Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, as long as their parameter lists are different.

### 35. (Medium) What is method overriding?
Method overriding means defining a method in a child class that already exists in the parent class with the same signature.

### 36. (Medium) What is encapsulation?
